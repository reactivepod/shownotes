28: You Are Asking For a Massive, Massive Unicorn

Apple takes on the US government. The Hyper Card cliff hanger that was not. In case you did not know what a quokka is - now you do. Some comments about Mr. Crockford. Writing tests for browser-JS is annoyingly hard. Beautiful pictures from space and Henning really needs a new twitter handle.
