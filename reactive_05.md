5: I Don't Know if You Are a Regular Podlebrity Anymore

Kahlil declares Raquel a Podlebrity and explains what that means. We then discuss the pending deletion of Raquel's wikipedia page, learn about Browserify and several of the related *ify modules such as Uglifyify. Henning confesses that he is not entirely over vim. In closing we discuss the various static site hosting options out there.
