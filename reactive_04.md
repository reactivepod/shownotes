4: Title TBD

Title choices
 - There are so many alphabets out there
 - Isn't it Alphabet's Google?
 - Self driving cars and other crazy stuff
 - Google is still the monopoly in search
 - Why doesn't everybody just use Bing
 - I hear Yahoo has a search ... its Bing
 - Why does BMW want alphabet.com?
 - I must say, Google Hangouts are really terrible
 - Its nice, it all just works
 - Even if you didn't use node ... sigh
 - Node is not the answer to everything
 - He got the tingly feeling in his pinky (actual quote)
 - Redux gave him a tingly feeling in his pinky (paraphrased, is that ok???)
 - Redux is inspired by Flux but it is much simpler
 - This Redux thing works with reducers
 - I just like this kind of move to the simplicity
 - one big ball of data

Our team is complete again for this episode! Raquel, Kahlil and Henning discuss Google's announcement about Alphabet and speculate about what it all means. Raquel shares her enthusiasm about the screen sharing app Screenhero and how it compares to other services and apps in the space. Henning reports on his progress with implementing JSON-API and last but not least Kahlil talks about Redux and client-side state management.
