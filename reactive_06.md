6: We Are A Mess Of Giggles

Raquel had some CSS issues this week and crafted a very amusing tweet about it. Our Slack channel is slowly growing and is now probably the best place to get in touch with us. We also discuss the Ember Community versioning project and the 2.0 release of Ember itself and how we wish more projects would follow this example. Kahlil released an npm package called esnow, which he discussed in a previous episode.
