3: TBD

Topic choices
 - I know someone who organized their wedding by Github issues
 - We are just making stuff up
 - They have no reason to give me Amazon S3 credentials
 - I do the "Oh gosh I'm scared dance on Slack"
 - I have a little imaginary line in my head
 - And sometimes you don't what to know
 - Ops is more like Biology
 - OMG I pushed to production on my first day!
 - The whole country goes on vacation for 4 weeks
 - I use technology

Raquel and Henning tackle this weeks topics without Kahlil who had other stuff to take care of. They speculate about what Github might do with the giant wad of cash they got in their series B funding and talk about how developers could benefit from knowing more about Opsy stuff. The last topic of the show is about meetups and how some of them are trying to set themselves apart by mixing it up with Music and having a cover charge that gets donated to charity. Food names for Javascript meetups seems to be an up and coming thing.
